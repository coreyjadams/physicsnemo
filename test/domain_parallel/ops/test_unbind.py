r"""``unbind`` handlers on ShardTensor (``custom_ops/_tensor_ops.py``).

Locks in the Partial-resolution semantics: unbinding an unreduced partial
sum must first resolve the pending reduction (differentiable allreduce to
``Replicate``), matching the SDPA/cross treatment. Slice attention in
physics_attention unbinds a Partial qkv projection under domain parallelism.
